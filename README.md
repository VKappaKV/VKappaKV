## Hi there 👋

This readme is still TBD, thinking about what suits me best at the moment.

For now just know that I'm a fullstack developer who loves to build out personal projects.

My tech Stack?

I really like to build out things using `Go`, but for most projects I've landed up on `Typescript` with my new favorite find `Bun` and for frameworks `React` or `Svelte` (my favorite).

Currently still building out a few of my projects and set up my portfolio.
